/**
 * The Iterator Pattern provides a way to traverse a collection without revealing
 * its underlying structure, offering a uniform interface for traversal.
 * <p>
 * Structure:
 * - Iterator: Interface for traversing a collection.
 * - Collection: Holds the elements and provides an iterator.
 * <p>
 * Benefits -
 * 1. Separation of Concerns: The traversal logic is separated from the collection itself, allowing you to change one without affecting the other.
 * 2. Uniform Interface: The same interface (Iterator) is used to traverse different types of collections, making the code more flexible.
 * 3. Simplified Client Code: The client doesnâ€™t need to know the underlying data structure, reducing coupling and making the code easier to maintain.
 * 4. Multiple Traversal Strategies: You can implement multiple types of iterators (e.g., forward, backward, filtered) without changing the collection.
