/**
 * Use the Strategy Pattern
 *  - When you need to define a family of algorithms,
 *  - Make them interchangeable
 *  - Let the client choose the behavior at runtime.
 *
 *  Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios with varying algorithms,
 *  avoiding conditional logic (if-else),
 *  or when you want to add new behaviors without modifying existing code.
 *
 *  Examples include payment methods, compression techniques, or sorting algorithms.
 *
 *  With the Strategy Pattern, the logic for each payment type is
 *  encapsulated in separate strategy classes, and the PaymentService
 *  (context class) delegates the task of payment processing to one of
 *  these strategies at runtime.
